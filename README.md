StarSide Jumpers

The motivation for this project was my 7 year old son Chase! He loves video games and always talks about making one someday. I made him a promise that I would work hard and do my best to create a great video game for him.
I used this motivation plus my interests in space exploration to come up with the idea of creating a 2D side scroller about traveling through different places in space.

This is a game using "TechWithTim" basic level design and collision features. The ultimate end goal for our game is to have missions and goals for each level. Upon level completion a new fun fact will appear on screen teaching you about something coorelating to the level design which we would ultimately like to resemble real space objects. Our target audience is children ages 8-15, giving them a fun interactive way to learn about space and other worldy objects!

This is my first attempt at PyGame and there is much to be done still as currently there is only a single level available. With the little knowledge I had and the crazy amount of learning that happened throughout the project I'm excited for the future of it. Any future changes will be noted and updated here in the repository.

Current Features:

-1 Level:
